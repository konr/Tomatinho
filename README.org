* About the program

  /Tomatinho/ is a simple and beautiful [[http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/][pomodoro technique]] timer that
  runs on Emacs and is not bloated with distractive graphics or inorganic
  commands. Just press Enter, see time flow and do you best.

* Using it

  I bind it here to /F12/ with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f12>") 'tomatinho)
#+END_SRC

  When you start /Tomatinho/, you automatically begin your first
  pomodoro. There is nothing to do at this point, except to work. You
  can, of course, restart the pomodoro if you get distracted, or even
  the whole series, but the program takes care of itself until the
  25-minute mark is reached. At this point, the pause period will
  start, and you'll have to press <Enter> when you done.

  This cycle goes on forever.

* Keybindings

| Key       | Description                                     |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------|
| <Enter>   | Forgoes the current pomodoro or leaves a break. |
| S-<Enter> | Deliberately pauses.                            |
| R         | Resets the timer.                               |
| <Tab>     | Toggles between display modes.                  |
| q         | Kills the buffer.                               |
| Q         | Turns off Tomatinho.                            |
* Customization

Now, you can customize tomatinho buffer name, the faces used, and
the length of a podomoro

To do so, run =M-x customize-group RET tomatinho=, and adjust the
settings to your liking.

Some more customs might be added in the future.

* Notification
You can set =tomatinho-update-hook= to show desired notification.

Example using =notify-send=:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp

(defun my-tomatinho-update-hook ()
  (play-sound-file-async tomatinho-sound-tick) ;; play tick sound every second
  (when (and (equal (car tomatinho-current) 'pause)
             (= (timestamp) tomatinho-last))
    (start-process "notify-send"
                   nil
                   "notify-send"
                   (format "tomatinho: make a pause (%s+%s)"
                           tomatinho-pomodoro-length
                           (cdr tomatinho-current))
                   "-t" "3000"
                   "-i" "/usr/share/icons/hicolor/16x16/apps/emacs.png")))

(add-hook 'tomatinho-update-hook #'my-tomatinho-update-hook)
#+END_SRC
